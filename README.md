My task was to first identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined.

From those industries (1), I needed to find the number of unicorns within these industries (2), the year that they became a unicorn (3), and their average valuation, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places (4).

With the above information I was able to finish my query to return a table containing industry, year, num_unicorns, and average_valuation_billions. For readability, the results were sorted by year and number of unicorns, both in descending order.
